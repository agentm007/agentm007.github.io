        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>my name is Alex Dexter and I am an information security specialist,
           currently working as a devops engineer. While I am working in devops,
           my passion is for information security. I am an extremely driven
           individual. If presented with a new technology or task I try and
           tackle it head on. I rarely find a challenge too difficult and want
           to constantly improve my skills. My personal research and work is
           what sets me apart from the crowd. While many people are interested
           in building new things I make it happen. With some time and hard work
           I hope to one day be a well respected name in information security.
           While there are plenty of people who want to learn work with
           information security I put it into practice.</p>
        <p>Currently I am looking to work as a penetration tester or an
           information security analyst. I spend most of my free time studying
           up for such a position. I would like to get my Certified Information
           Systems Security Professional certificate as well as my Offensive
           Security Certified Professional certificate.I frequently participate
           in online capture the flags and security research, to build my skills.
           Some of my recent projects include my basic honey pot program and my
           penetration testing suite shiva. All of my current projects can be
           found on <a href="https://github.com/agentm007">github</a>.</p>
